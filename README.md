MY APPROACH:

#1. Create a template html file of the online ecommerce demo store using just one page to present products.
#2. Style this using css.
#3. decide on which frontend and backend stack to use(I have decided to go with react, redux and node).
#4. Create the react homescreen and product screen and test using data.js objects locally imported(i will nto be using a sign in service).
#5. once the homescreen and productscreens was working to create the backend api using node and express.
#6. create redux implemention.
#7. create the cart system.
#8. Implement the product Search function and make this filter like pagination.
#9. Implement the go to checkout button and get this to direct to a checkout page which will have no functionality as this is only for demo purposes

Running:

#1 run the backend server by going to the backend folder and using #npm start
#2 go into the frontend folder and again using #npm start to start the frontend service.

Future Improvement:

#1. A wider range of products.
#2. A catergory system to be implemented and able to select the catergories.
#3. A sorting system so products can be put into various orders.
#4. A checkout and payment screen to be added.
#5. Implement a mongoDB database to enable database use instead of data.js object file located localy.
